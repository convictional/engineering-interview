## Engineering Challenge V2

The purpose of this challenge is to gauge your experience with writing mapping and validation functions for transferring data from one data model to another. It’s one of the important aspects of the product that we are building, and provides helpful context around your comfort level and design choices working with integrations. The systems we work with sometimes have undocumented behavior when it comes to the way their data models interface with ours, which means we have to be creative.

To complete the challenge, write some code that handles the following specification in any language you like. We use Go internally, but we try not to be dogmatic about which language you use here. We’re looking for well thought out, maintainable and readable code in any language you want. That doesn’t mean over do it, nothing is worse than a file with two lines of comments for every single definition. Just do your best and help us understand your process.

Here are some things you might need:
